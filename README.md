# Created for quick mass physical format music logging
# Useful lightweight CLI tool to log no barcode records and CDs from your collection
# Simply execute and pass data with the -w flag and a music.txt file will form in the same folder with your inputted data
# Data can be searched through grep music.txt or the program's read tool
# Data should be typed in snake_case or kebab-case, failure to do so will result in an error or unexpected output
# Inputs are not sanitized and will break the program if adherence to the prompt guide is not followed
# Prompt guide is printed upon specifying amount of songs

MORE: Inputs can and should be sanitized, however it is too tedious in C and I'd rather move on from this small project
